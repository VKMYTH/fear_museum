With withered trees, fallen leaves, and graves all around, the scene feels eerie. The soul reaper's face is hidden in shadows, and a pale moonlight creates an eerie glow, while a looming, skull/deathly aura adds to the ominous atmosphere, evoking the fear of death."/>

      <Feature title="Technique 1 - Symbolism" text="The use of symbolism plays a vital role in instilling the fear of death in the viewer through presence of graves scattered throughout the moonlit graveyard, the skull aura looming behind the soul reaper, and the lone skull on the ground emphasizes the inescapable reality of death." />
      <Feature title="Technique 2 - Monumental-ism" text="The monumental-ism of the skull aura surrounding the reaper amplifies the fear of death by making it appear all-encompassing and overpowering. Its immense presence makes everything else appear small in the artwork, portraying inescapable mortality." />
      <Feature title="Technique 3 - Contrast and Lighting" text="The contrast in lighting, with the reaper holding a light with the pale moonlight, exemplifies the fear of death by casting shadows and eerie highlights. This light and darkness adds a eerie dimension to the scene, adding to the the uncertainty and dread associated with mortality and making it more vivid"/>
